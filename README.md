# Modeling Spatial Distribution of the Urban Poor through Agent-based Models

## Abstract 
The spatial distribution of a cityâ€™s population has long been the focus for urban sociologists, geographers, and economists. The factors that determine population distribution can be complex and interconnected. Understanding where different income groups, especially urban poor, are located in cities allows us to identify areas that have high social risks and design policies accordingly. In my capstone, I want to explore using agent-based modeling to simulate the residential dynamics of different income population given the economic factors (e.g., land price, housing price, density, etc.) in a monocentric city and experiment with the mechanisms that drive spatial differentiation of different income groups. Furthermore, I want to experiment whether differentiating low-income population into the subtle subgroups (e.g., urban migrants, college students, and local poor) will lead to spatially different residential choices.
